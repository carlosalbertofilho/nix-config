# nix-config

My NixOS configurations, it's my first attempt to build a config to use this SO.

# How to use

To use this, you only need to clone this repository in `/etc/nixos`:

```
git clone git@github.com:squiter/nix-config.git /etc/nixos
chown -R 1000:100 /etc/nixos # to avoid need root to edit the files
```

And then you can follow the installation of the system.
